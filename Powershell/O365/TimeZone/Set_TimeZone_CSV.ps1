Overview:
This script sets the timezone, date format, and language for mailboxes in the "bhcs.sfet.org.uk" domain based on a list of UPNs provided in a CSV file.

Issue Context:
Mailboxes in Exchange Online have two time zones; one in regional settings and the other in working hours.
These are both set to Pacific Standard Time by default, regardless of where the mailbox is created or what tenant or Exchange regional settings are in place.
