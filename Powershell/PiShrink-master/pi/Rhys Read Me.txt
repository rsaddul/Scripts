Make shared folder on windows and add your pi image into the folder then map it in Oracle via Shared Folders.

Add yourself to Ubuntu Virtualbox User permissions. (This will allow you to access your shared folder) 
Open Terminal and run sudo adduser yourusername vboxsf
If you dont know your username you can type whoami in Terminal

Open Terminal in Ubuntu and browse to your shared folder i.e cd /media/sf_PiShrink-master/pi
apply the following permissions to the script in your public folder   chmod +x pishrink.sh

the following command will overwrite your current img into the shrinked size and should expand partitons on boot
sudo ./pishrink.sh Rhys_Pi_Kodi_18_Leia_2020.img 

the following command will make a copy of your img and work off that
sudo ./pishrink.sh currentimagefile.img [newimgagefile.img]

If you need to download the script you can use the following command in terminal (dont forget to apply permission to your script- see above)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Drewsif/PiShrink/master/pishrink.sh
